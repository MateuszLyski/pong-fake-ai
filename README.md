# Pong Illusion

A simple Java program that simulates a Pong-like game. Although it looks like two players are playing, it's actually a basic illusion using `if` statements and simple logic. No real AI, just clever fakes.

## Features

- two "players" controlled by basic rules
- ball movement and paddle bounce logic
- simple score tracking
- no user interaction â€“ fully automatic simulation
